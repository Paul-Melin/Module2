Median=42
Mean=50
Values: 20/34/34/12/56/110/49/a/b
(20+34+34+12+56+110+49+a+b)/9=50
a+b = 135
a=42
b=93

Let's calculate the mean to check = 450/9 = 50
Let's check the median = The fifth value is 42

Challenge 2

Here it's risky to try to calculate a mean of a mean : we know the average speed but we don't know the distanceor the duration of the travel.

Challenge 3

See the graph on the picture
Around 300 on total frequency of 400 lights bulbs have a lifetime less then 480 hours so we can say 75% have a lifetime less then 480 hours.

Challenge 4

Median= 60 patients so the median is the 30st values so here it is in the range 40-59.
Median = 40+(((60/2)-29)/17)*19=41,12

Mean : Let's calculate the midpoints:
9,5/29,5/49,5/69,5/89,5/109,5/129,5/149,5/169,5
Multiply and sum frequency by midpoints and divide it by population:
Mean=2790/60=46,5

Standard deviation: Let's calculate the square of the difference of midpoints with mean and then multiply it with frequency:
21904/3757/153/2116/7396/11907/6889/10609/15129
standard deviation = square.root(79860/60-1)= 36,79
